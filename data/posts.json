  "content": "## Introduction\nOnline shopping has grown rapidly, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. With increased dependency on digital payments and home deliveries, financial fraud has also risen. Fraud often occurs through manipulated deliveries, misleading reviews, or unauthorized access. Prior research shows that nearly **25% of online transactions are wrongly declined**, and younger customers are more vulnerable to fraud. This motivated the development of an AI-driven fraud detection system.\n\n## Motivation\nTraditional, rule-based fraud detection methods are limited and cannot handle complex, evolving fraud patterns. This project integrates **Generative AI** with machine learning to:\n- Identify emotional tone and hidden patterns in product reviews.\n- Analyze user behavior to detect anomalies.\n- Provide a data-driven framework that adapts to new fraud techniques.\n\n## Dataset Used\nThe dataset is sourced from the **Kaggle Amazon Product Reviews** repository with **568,454 reviews** and **10 features** (seller details, payment data, product info, reviews, etc.). Preprocessing includes:\n- Removing unnecessary columns\n- Handling missing values\n- Text cleaning and normalization\n- Removing duplicates\n- Lemmatization\n- Bag-of-Words generation\n\n## Text Transformation\nReviews are transformed into matrix form using **TF-IDF**, which captures both word frequency and importance across the dataset. This enhances the detection of fraud indicators hidden within review text.\n\n## Machine Learning Model: SVM\n**Support Vector Machine (SVM)** is used due to its robustness in high-dimensional text data. An **80–20 split** is applied:\n- 80% training\n- 20% testing\n\nSVM classifies review patterns to determine legitimate vs. suspicious activity.\n\n## Results\nA confusion matrix evaluates performance by comparing predicted vs. actual labels. The model achieved:\n\n### **✔ Accuracy: 98.8%**\n\nMismatches (False Positives and False Negatives) are strong fraud signals and are flagged for deeper analysis. Additional fraud cases are identified when repeated suspicious reviews originate from the same user or source.\n\n## Conclusion\nThis project demonstrates that combining **Generative AI + SVM** provides a highly accurate fraud detection system (98.8%). It significantly reduces financial risks by identifying suspect reviews and potential fraudulent activities. Future work may include deep learning models, real-time fraud detection, and advanced anomaly detection.\n\n---\nBased on the research paper and presentation delivered at **IEEE SILCON-2025**, NIT Nagaland."
